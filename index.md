My primary occupation is kotlin programming, you can find more info about my experience [here](/projects).
However, I am also interested in many other things, such as travelling, chinese tea, meeting new people, and taking notes to my markdown vault (yes, very dull).

Also here would be some of my talks/articles I will probably make in the future.
