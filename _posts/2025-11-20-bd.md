title: When is my birthday?
---

Unfortunately, I often forget people's birthdays. I can easily forget the birthday of
a close friend or even my mum's. 
I don't mind if people don't congratulate me on my birthday, because it's just an ordinary day. 
I think it's lovely to give gifts for no particular reason. 

So feel free to give me a gift for no reason ⬇︎
