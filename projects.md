My primary area is kotlin development. I mostly do android projects, but I'm open for other project suggestions.

There are much projects I've been participating on, but I'll add most of them later. If you want my CV, you can [contact](/) me.

# Commercial

I'm currently working on a commercial R&D project in **kotlin** for a quantitative finance project. 

# Side- / Pet-

I also do some side projects, e.g. [Kotlin Meta](https://www.youtube.com/@KotlinMeta) and [Friendly](https://github.com/friendly-social/) project with my friends. 
Many projects have since been abandoned for various reasons.

Most of them I'll add later, but you can see some of them at my [github/demndevel](https://github.com/demndevel).
